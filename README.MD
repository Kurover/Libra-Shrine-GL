# Introduction
An attempt to create a fantasy world, shown to you through a book you receive from a well-known faction in this said world. Welcome to Ground Leaf Project! More details from the wiki itself.

This project is built from ground up using Tiddly Wiki. Unlike the main homepage, there's no funny restriction like HTML+CSS only. Though I keep this project as simple as it could both in reader and creator perspective.
